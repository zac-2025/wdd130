          <h3>Who can go to the Temple?</h3>
          <p>
            Before the temple is dedicated, there is an open house where anyone can attend. After it is dedicated,
            only members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who have qualified to have a temple 
            recommend may enter. Anyone who is a member of the Church who is willing to follow the standards required
            to receive a recommend can do so.

          <h3>Christ is the center of the Temple</h3>
          <p>
            In the Temple we preform ordinances(make promises) first for ourselves and later for our 
            deseaced ansestors. These promises are made with Jesus Christ by the power of His preisthood.
            All ordinances are centered on Christ and becoming more like Him.

          <h3>What is a Temple?</h3>
          <p>
            Temples are more than just buildings. They are considered the House of the Lord—places where individuals 
            can make sacred covenants, feel God’s presence, and receive guidance through eternal ordinances. Every element 
            of the temple, from its architecture to its artwork, points toward eternal families and divine truths.
