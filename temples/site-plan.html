        Welcome to the Temple Website
        This site is a peaceful place where visitors can learn more about temples, their sacred purpose, and 
        how they connect individuals and families to God. Whether you’re just curious or preparing for your 
        first temple experience, this site will help guide your journey with clarity and reverence.

      </p>
      <p>
        Temples are more than just buildings. They are considered the House of the Lord—places where individuals 
        can make sacred covenants, feel God’s presence, and receive guidance through eternal ordinances. Every element 
        of the temple, from its architecture to its artwork, points toward eternal families and divine truths.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website serves as a central hub of information, offering history, updates, photos, and guidance. Explore the 
        Timeline to see how temples have expanded over the years, or visit the Announcements page to stay updated on 
        closures, events, and historical facts. Each page is designed to help members and visitors feel more connected to the 
        purpose of temples and to inspire a greater appreciation for their spiritual power.

      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>
      The Timeline page offers a dynamic, visual way to explore the history of temple building across time and place. 
      A large interactive map shows dots representing each temple around the world. As the animation plays, you'll see 
      the temples appear in the order they were announced, constructed, and dedicated—bringing to life the global growth 
      of temple worship.
      </p>
      <p>
      This looped timeline highlights key milestones, from early temple announcements in the 1800s to the modern-day 
      surge of temples in countries across the globe. Visitors can pause and click on specific temples to view short 
      descriptions or dates, creating an immersive and educational experience.
      </p>
      <p>
      The timeline reminds us that the work of building temples is ongoing. Each dot on the map represents a place 
      where individuals can draw closer to God and participate in sacred ordinances. Whether you are looking for 
      historical context, planning a temple trip, or simply admiring the scope of the Church’s growth, this timeline 
      provides a meaningful look into the spiritual expansion of temple worship.

        temple listed includes a photo, the name of the Church leader who dedicated it, the date it was announced, 
        and the date it was completed. This visual layout helps visitors recognize important moments in temple history 
        and discover more about the temple nearest to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to temple facts, this page includes closure notices, special ordinance events, and holiday schedules. 
        Whether you’re planning a visit or just want to stay informed, the Announcements page helps you prepare with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each temple’s design reflects the spiritual and cultural significance of its location. From intricate carvings 
        to symbolic artwork, the gallery showcases the uniqueness of every temple. Visitors can explore differences in 
        layout, materials, and symbolism, helping them appreciate how each sacred structure teaches eternal truths through 
        inspired architecture.
