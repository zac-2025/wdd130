    <h2>Zac</h2>

    <p> I’m a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Army. 
        I’m originally from Idaho Falls, Idaho. 
        I working on getting a degree in Software Engineering, 
        which directly supports my role in the military, 
        where I work with Geospatial Information Systems (GIS). After my time in the Army, 
        I hope to pursue a career in GIS, ideally in a position that allows me to continue using and 
        expanding my technical skills.
